    "brand_response": "Hi there,\n\nThanks so much for choosing BlueBush! It’s lovely to hear you’ve picked up the Maireana linen in Sage—that’s one of our favourite colours this season.\n\nTo keep them beautifully soft, we recommend a gentle machine wash on a cool cycle (30°C is perfect). Use a mild, eco-friendly detergent and avoid bleach, as it can weaken the natural flax fibres. If you can, line drying in the shade is best for longevity and the environment, but a cool tumble dry works too.\n\nThey actually get softer with every wash, so enjoy the process!\n\nWarmly,\nThe BlueBush Team"

    "brand_response": "Hi,\n\nWe totally get that—nobody wants to feel sticky at the beach!\n\nOur 'Kakadu Plum Zinc' is formulated to be 'Clear Zinc'. It goes on white so you can see where you've missed, but rubs in completely clear within seconds. It uses a natural coconut oil base, so it feels more like a moisturiser than a heavy paste.\n\nHope that helps you stay sun-safe!\n\nCheers,\nThe BlueBush Team"
